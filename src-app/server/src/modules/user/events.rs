// vocabulary for a login-audit feature that isn't wired. Re-add them alongside
// their emit site + subscriber if/when that feature lands.)

// The former `impl UserEvent` AppEvent-wrapping constructors were removed in
// Chunk BG. Callers now build the raw `UserEvent` variant and hand it to the
// injected `AuthEventSink::emit_user` (see `modules::auth::context`); the app's
// sink impl performs the `AppEvent::User(..)` wrapping, so the user module no
// longer names the app-aggregate event enum.
