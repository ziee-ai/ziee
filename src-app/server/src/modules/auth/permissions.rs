//! Permission keys for the auth module's admin surfaces.
//!
//! These gate the `/api/admin/auth-providers` CRUD + test endpoints.
//! The public OAuth flow (`/api/auth/oauth/*`, `/api/auth/providers`,
//! `/api/auth/link-account`) is intentionally NOT permission-gated —
//! those endpoints are reached by unauthenticated users mid-login.
//!
//! Both permissions are implicitly held by the Administrators group
//! via its `*` wildcard, so no seed migration is needed. Operators
//! who want to delegate auth-provider management to a non-admin
//! group can grant `auth_providers::read` and/or `auth_providers::manage`
//! through the existing group-permissions UI.
