# TEST_RESULTS — agent-core / chat re-home

Real, per-test pass/fail. Every PASS below was RUN this session with the log path
noted. Bridge = live Qwen at `ZIEE_TEST_LLM_BASE_URL` (:4000).

## Primary gate — two-flag regression (core-path refactor ⇒ regression is the gate)

| Suite | Flag OFF (legacy) | Flag ON (agent-core) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chat::` integration | 162 pass / 9 fail | 162 pass / 9 fail | **0 regressions** — identical set (9 = env-gated real-LLM/npx, red on BOTH) |
| `mcp::` integration | 457 pass / 40 fail | 457 pass / 40 fail | **0 real regressions** — 2 diff-flips confirmed flakes (pass in isolation; flag can't touch them) |

Logs: `logs/regress_chat_{OFF,ON}.log`, `logs/regress_mcp_{OFF,ON}.log`.
The migration is blast-radius-clean on both touched subsystems.

## Verified PASS (authored + run this session)

### agent-core crate (unit) — TEST-1..13, 34, 36
`cargo test -p agent-core` → **36/36 PASS** (loop, ports, budget, tokens, policy,
reviewer, compaction, fanout, extension seam, streaming, cancel, resume, terminal
tool). Incl. **TEST-36** `tests/deps_boundary.rs` — port-boundary dep set asserted.

### Integration (`tests/agent/`, `tests/chat/`, `tests/workflow/`)
- **TEST-20/21** `agent/settings_test.rs` — GET/PUT roundtrip + bounds→400 + sync + 401/403. **2/2 PASS**.
- **TEST-41** `agent/model_resolver_test.rs` — owner-allowed / outsider-denied model access. **PASS**.
- **TEST-27** `agent/migration_test.rs` — `agent_transcript_json` jsonb + `resumable` CHECK + `review_classification` col + `agent_admin_settings` seeded. **PASS**.
- **TEST-14** `agent/journal_test.rs` — bridge workflow `kind:agent` tool call journaled to `mcp_tool_calls` + linked via `workflow_run_id`, sanitized `result_json`. **PASS** (`logs/test14.log`).
- **TEST-24** `chat/agent_core_parity_test.rs` — SSE sequence + block persistence parity legacy↔core. **PASS**.
- **TEST-25** `chat/extension_split_test.rs` — assistant system prompt precedes user message in wire order (StubChat capture). **PASS**.
- **TEST-15/16** `workflow/agent_step_test.rs` — `kind:agent` step runs the shared loop to completion + records output. **PASS**.
- **TEST-40** existing `workflow::tool` suite unchanged after `ToolDispatcher → call_mcp_tool` extraction — **11/11 PASS** (`logs/test40_toolstep.log`).
- **TEST-38** existing `chat::` suite on the core path — covered by the two-flag regression above (162/9 ON == OFF).

### Real-LLM against the bridge (flag ON)
- `mcp/agent_core_tool_bridge_test.rs` — real Qwen turn calls an MCP echo tool: mcpToolStart→execute→complete. **PASS**.
- `mcp/agent_core_multiturn_bridge_test.rs` — 2-turn agentic chat; turn-1 tool value (`purple-turtle-42`) persists into turn-2 context. **PASS**.
- `agent-core/tests/real_llm_loop.rs` — tool round-trip + 332 streamed deltas. **PASS**.

### E2E (Playwright)
- **TEST-31** `settings/agent-settings.spec.ts` — admin edits `default_max_steps`, saves, reload persists. **PASS** (~2.6m).
- **TEST-32** `[negative-perm]` `settings/agent-settings-negperm.spec.ts` (A10) — a user lacking `agent::settings::read` sees NO nav entry + NO card; admin sees both. **PASS** (~2.5m). *(The mandatory frontend authz proof.)*

`npm run check (ui)`: tsc + guardrails + colors + agent-scoped `gate:ui` (0 HIGH) PASS;
`check:testid-registry` fails on **pre-existing base debt** (reproduces on clean HEAD,
repo-wide regen out of scope).

### Newly authored + run this session (the rigorous-path deliverables)

- **TEST-23** `agent/verification_test.rs` — fabricated DOI → `not_found` (never
  invented) through the agent-core loop (bridge; deterministic resolver-404
  anchor). **PASS** (`logs/test23_verification.log`).
- **TEST-17/18/37** `workflow/agent_step_resume_test.rs` — the `kind:agent`
  durable review gate: forced-High reviewer parks `waiting`; snapshot written at
  the gate boundary; the tool is blocked pre-approval; the boot sweep SPARES the
  run; approve → cold resume → completes; the approved tool executes on resume.
  **PASS** (`logs/test17_resume.log`).
- **TEST-22** `agent/reviewer_test.rs` — a mutating call under `OnRequest`
  escalates via the reviewer to the durable gate, and the classification PERSISTS
  to `mcp_tool_calls.review_classification` after resume. **PASS**
  (`logs/test22_reviewer.log`). *This test caught + drove a real bug fix:* the
  classification was being discarded across the durable-gate boundary (never
  populated in production) — now carried through the gate record + re-seeded on
  resume.

These were made deterministic by a **debug-only** `ZIEE_AGENT_FORCE_RISK` seam
(`cfg!(debug_assertions)`, physically absent in release) that fixes the reviewer's
classification without depending on a small model classifying `High`.

### Descoped (human-approved DECISIONS DEC-23; PLAN ITEM-7/10/27/29/31 `[DESCOPED]`)

- **TEST-19** (fan-out) — `Fanout::fan_out` has NO production caller and
  `allow_delegate` is never `true`: fan-out/`delegate` is unit-tested crate code,
  not wired into the loop this pass (ITEM-7/27). Cannot be authored against a
  production path that doesn't exist.
- **TEST-26** (tool verbosity) — no `verbosity` symbol exists; ITEM-10 unbuilt.
- **TEST-28/29/30/33** (agent-chat / parallel-search / workflow-run / progress
  e2e) — grep finds NO such UI; the cutover reused the existing chat UI + run
  view (ITEM-29/31 unbuilt). No surface to test.
- **TEST-39** (existing chat e2e on the flag) — the flag is opt-in (default
  legacy) so the shipped UX is byte-identical; backend parity is already the gate
  (TEST-38, 162/9 ON==OFF).
