# TESTS — logout session invalidation

Every ITEM-1..12 is covered by ≥1 TEST below. The diff touches a frontend workspace
(`src-app/ui/**`), so `tier: e2e` specs are enumerated (TEST-18..20). The feature introduces **no new
permission**, so no `[negative-perm]` restricted-user e2e is required (A10 not triggered).

No cosmetic tests: every assertion below either drives a real HTTP path against a real server + DB, or
drives the real Zustand store. The only mocked boundary is `@/api-client` in the vitest store tests
(the store's external boundary).

## Unit — Rust

- **TEST-1** (tier: unit) [covers: ITEM-3] file: `src-app/server/src/modules/auth/jwt.rs` — asserts: an access token minted with `token_version = 7` round-trips through `validate_access_token` carrying `ver == Some(7)`, and a refresh token minted alongside carries `ver == None`.
- **TEST-2** (tier: unit) [covers: ITEM-3] file: `src-app/server/src/modules/auth/jwt.rs` — asserts: a hand-encoded `Claims`-shaped JSON with NO `ver` field deserializes successfully with `ver == None` — pinning the `#[serde(default)]` back-compat contract that keeps pre-deploy tokens working.
- **TEST-3** (tier: unit) [covers: ITEM-4] file: `src-app/server/src/modules/auth/jwt_extractor.rs` — asserts: `verify_token_version` — the single comparison rule shared by both read paths — returns Ok when `Some(3)` vs db `3`; Err(401 `SESSION_REVOKED`) when `Some(3)` vs db `4`; and **Ok when `None` vs db `0`** (a pre-migration token against a default column).

## Integration — Rust (`src-app/server/tests/`)

- **TEST-4** (tier: integration) [covers: ITEM-1, ITEM-8] file: `src-app/server/tests/auth/session_refresh_test.rs` — asserts: **THE CORE GAP** — register → `/auth/me` 200 → `POST /auth/logout` 204 → `/auth/me` with the SAME (unexpired) access token → **401 with error_code `SESSION_REVOKED`**.
- **TEST-5** (tier: integration) [covers: ITEM-4] file: `src-app/server/tests/auth/session_refresh_test.rs` — asserts: after logout, the two bare-`JwtAuth` routes that neither `me` nor `RequirePermissions` covers — `GET /api/onboarding/progress` and `GET /api/hub/installed` — both 401. Proves the extractor-level coverage claim.
- **TEST-6** (tier: integration) [covers: ITEM-2, ITEM-5] file: `src-app/server/tests/auth/session_refresh_test.rs` — asserts: after logout, a `RequirePermissions`-gated route returns 401 with the old token — using **`GET /api/conversations`**, i.e. the literal reported leak (the ex-admin's conversations). Exercises the folded `get_by_id_with_token_version` read path.
- **TEST-7** (tier: integration) [covers: ITEM-6, ITEM-7] file: `src-app/server/tests/auth/session_refresh_test.rs` — asserts: logout → login again **within the same wall-clock second** (no sleep) → `/auth/me` **200**. The executable proof that the rejected `sessions_revoked_at`-vs-`iat` design is broken and the counter is not.
- **TEST-8** (tier: integration) [covers: ITEM-6] file: `src-app/server/tests/auth/session_refresh_test.rs` — asserts: **LOGOUT ATOMICITY** — with a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on `refresh_tokens` that `RAISE EXCEPTION`s (installed via `sqlx::PgPool::connect(&server.database_url)` on this test's own unique DB), `POST /auth/logout` fails → `users.token_version` is **UNCHANGED**, the access token still 200s, and (trigger dropped) the refresh token still rotates. Both-or-neither: no bump-without-revoke window in which a held refresh token re-mints a valid access token past logout.
- **TEST-9** (tier: integration) [covers: ITEM-9] file: `src-app/server/tests/auth/session_refresh_test.rs` — asserts: **read-before-claim** — a refresh whose rotation has already been claimed, racing a logout, yields a token stamped with the OLD `ver` → `/auth/me` 401. Asserts the ordering invariant, not a sleep.
- **TEST-10** (tier: integration) [covers: ITEM-6] file: `src-app/server/tests/auth/session_refresh_test.rs` — asserts: user A's logout leaves user B's access token working (the bump is per-user, not global).
- **TEST-11** (tier: integration) [covers: ITEM-3] file: `src-app/server/tests/auth/session_refresh_test.rs` — asserts: a hand-minted `ver`-less token (signed with the server's secret) still authenticates against a `token_version = 0` user → 200. Pins the zero-forced-logout-at-deploy story.
- **TEST-12** (tier: integration) [covers: ITEM-8] file: `src-app/server/tests/sync/delivery_test.rs` — asserts: logout fans a `Session` signal to the user's OTHER devices — two `SyncProbe`s for one user; logout carrying probe-1's `X-Sync-Connection-Id` → probe-2 `expect_event("session","update")` AND probe-1 `expect_silence` (origin suppression). Mirrors `deactivating_a_user_mid_stream_closes_their_sync_stream`.
- **TEST-13** (tier: integration) [covers: ITEM-12] file: `src-app/server/tests/auth/mod.rs` — asserts: `test_auth_logout` no longer documents the bug as expected ("JWT is stateless, so the token will still work after logout") but asserts the post-logout access token is rejected.

## Unit — frontend (vitest, jsdom; `vitest.config.ts` already includes `src/**/*.store.test.ts`)

- **TEST-14** (tier: unit) [covers: ITEM-10, ITEM-11] file: `src-app/ui/src/modules/auth/Auth.store.test.ts` — asserts: `logoutUser()` wipes the session INCLUDING `permissions` (`[]`) and `hasPassword` (`false`) — not just `token`/`user` — and calls `window.location.reload` exactly once.
- **TEST-15** (tier: unit) [covers: ITEM-10] file: `src-app/ui/src/modules/auth/Auth.store.test.ts` — asserts: **desktop safety** — with a `refreshFallback` registered, `logoutUser()` does NOT reload (the desktop bundle is never bounced to a login page), while still clearing state.
- **TEST-16** (tier: unit) [covers: ITEM-10] file: `src-app/ui/src/modules/auth/Auth.store.test.ts` — asserts: a terminal 401 from `/auth/refresh` (no fallback) tears down and reloads once, leaving `isAuthenticated === false`.
- **TEST-17** (tier: unit) [covers: ITEM-10] file: `src-app/ui/src/modules/auth/Auth.store.test.ts` — asserts: **desktop permanence** — a terminal refresh 401 WITH a `refreshFallback` that re-mints does NOT reload and leaves `token` non-null. Pins that the existing `if (refreshFallback)` guard still precedes the teardown.
- **TEST-18** (tier: unit) [covers: ITEM-11] file: `src-app/ui/src/modules/auth/Auth.store.test.ts` — asserts: `setAuthFromAutoLogin` clears the PREVIOUS identity's `permissions` at the same tick it flips `isAuthenticated: true` — no authenticated render window with a foreign permission set.

## E2E — Playwright (`--workers=1`; never `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` — the SSE stream never settles)

- **TEST-19** (tier: e2e) [covers: ITEM-10] file: `src-app/ui/tests/e2e/auth/logout.spec.ts` — asserts: logging out via the profile dropdown lands on the login form AND leaves `localStorage['auth-storage']` parsed `state.token === null` (so a reloaded tab cannot resurrect the session).
- **TEST-20** (tier: e2e) [covers: ITEM-8, ITEM-10] file: `src-app/ui/tests/e2e/sync/session-sync.spec.ts` — asserts: **THE REPORTED CROSS-TAB SYMPTOM** — tab 1 and tab 2 in the SAME context (`page.context().newPage()`, so shared localStorage + cookies = true tabs, NOT `browser.newContext()`); logout in tab 1 → tab 2 shows the login form **with no reload driven by the test**. Exercises the whole chain: bump → publish → SSE → `/auth/me` 401 → interceptor → refresh 401 → teardown.
- **TEST-21** (tier: e2e) [covers: ITEM-4, ITEM-5] file: `src-app/ui/tests/e2e/auth/logout.spec.ts` — asserts: **the server-side backstop, independent of the SSE signal** — tab 2 with `route('**/api/sync/subscribe', r => r.abort())` before navigating; logout in tab 1; tab 2's next navigation/click hits the login form rather than admin data. This is what makes cutting BroadcastChannel defensible.

## Added in DRIFT-1 (impl-wins)

- **TEST-22** (tier: integration) [covers: ITEM-13] file: `src-app/server/tests/mcp/builtin_test_connection_test.rs` — asserts: after a logout has bumped the user's epoch (0→1), a re-logged-in user's built-in (loopback) MCP servers still pass `POST /mcp/system-servers/test-connection`. Proves the internal service-to-service JWT is minted with the CURRENT `token_version`; a defaulted/stale epoch would 401 every built-in tool call (memory, files, web_search, code_sandbox…) for any user who had ever logged out. Extends the existing enumerate-every-built-in regression test, so a future built-in inherits the coverage.
